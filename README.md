# Opinionated Global Admin security best practices

> Note: This project is not associated or endorsed by Microsoft

## Why this page?

Microsoft maintains [their recommended security best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/best-practices) but those can't be applied in all cases, and sometimes those roles shouldn't be followed at all because the recommendations make each other impossible to follow. 

### Proof #1

Limit the number of Global Administrators to less than 5

_In some cases one might take this recommendation as a hard limit, but how could you apply this rule at an organization which follows a `24/7` operating model with support group members at least in three locations, where maintaining a healthy workload - allowing people to go on vacation with someone else being available - is a must? In this case they would need at least 3 x 2 = 6 people being assigned the Global admin role. Which is already 50% more people than what Microsoft recomments._

### Proof #2

Limit the number of privileged role assignments to less than 10

_When you want to follow the least privileged security practices and have at least 2 people on your team you can only assign them 4-5 roles and than you'll run unti the "less than 10" limit._

## Real life best practices

Let's get to those "Opinionated" security best practices, since you are reading this page to get to them, right?

### Our options

From the following unordered options, we can select those that make sense to our risk appetite and operational model:

- phishing resistant authentication
- privileged identity management
- dedicated admin account
- conditional access policy for compliant device
- conditional access policy for trusted network location
- dedicated privileged admin workstation
